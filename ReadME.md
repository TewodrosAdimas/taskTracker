# Task Tracker

A simple Task Tracker built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. Completed tasks are moved to the bottom of the list, while incomplete tasks remain at the top.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Enter a task description and add it to the list.
- **Mark Task as Complete**: Check a box to mark a task as completed, which will move it to the bottom of the list.
- **Unmark Task as Incomplete**: Uncheck a completed task to restore its position to the top.
- **Delete Task**: Remove a task from the list.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML structure of the project, containing input, button, and task list elements.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the layout and design of the task tracker.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles adding, completing, and deleting tasks through DOM manipulation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start using the Task Tracker.
